# vanillaJS-momentum-clone-coding
Let's clone code momentum with Nomadcoder. Technology stack :) HTML, CSS, JS

I wrote javascript and a few html while watching the nomadcoder lecture, and CSS wrote it myself. 
Based on the lecture, I implemented a favorite site that was not included in the lecture. 
Other details have also been embodied.

✅ Things to improve.
In the link part, https://www.${newurl.text}.com/ If it is not www or does not end with .com, the site cannot be entered.

> The user must save the URL and site name to be.
